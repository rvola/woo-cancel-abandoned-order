Cancel "on hold" orders after a certain number of days or by hours

![banner](/.github/banner.jpg)

## Description

**Cancel Abandoned Order** allows you to add a small option that will take care of dealing with "abandoned" commands.

If you have check or transfer type orders for example, you will be able to set a maximum number of days or by hours to receive the payment.

Cancel Abandoned Order, will take care of checking this and change the status of the order to "Cancel" if you have not received payment on time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Does this plugin use Action Scheduler

Yes we have started the migration to Action Scheduler (recurring action) since version 1.9.0

#### What does the plugin do?

Depending on the options defined in the payment gateway options page, the system will cancel orders whose payments have not been received.

#### Mode
You can cancel orders in hours or days.
For example, if I put the mode "Hourly", I can cancel orders pending after 2 hours.
Another example, in mode "Daily", I can cancel orders that I have not received payment within 7 days.

The execution of the cleaning is done like this:
Mode **"hourly"**: every hour to 00 minutes
Mode **"Daily"**: every day at 0:00

_Since version 1.9.0, the action is no longer executed at XXh00. Refer to the "Scheduled Actions" tab of the "Status" page of WooCommerce._

#### I would like to cancel orders pending payment

Follow the [tutorial here](https://github.com/rvola/woo-cancel-abandoned-order/wiki/Change-the-status-type-for-the-cancellation-process) to change the status of orders to cancel. By default the "wc-on-hold" commands are canceled.
